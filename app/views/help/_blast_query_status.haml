%p LigerCat is performing a live BLAST to find similar sequences to your query. Once the sequences are identified, LigerCat will use its indices to map the genes into a set of PubMed articles that reference those genes, and extract all the MeSH terms for those articles.
%p.bottom When all the MeSH descriptors are gathered, LigerCat uses a statistical model to identify relevant descriptors, then sums them by frequency to create the MeSH tag clouds.
