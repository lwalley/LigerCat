# This module serves as a lookup table for MeSH Terms, last updated 18 June 2012
#
# Using MeshKeywordLookup.[], you can look up the MeSH ID
# for any MeSH Heading. Since there are not very many MeSH
# terms, it's faster to hold these in memory than to hit the DB
#
# MeSH lookups are NOT case sensitive.
#
# === Example
# MeshKeywordLookup['aging']
# => 375
