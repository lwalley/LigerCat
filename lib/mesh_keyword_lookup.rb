  # This module serves as a lookup table for MeSH Terms, last updated 22 June 2012
  #
  # DO NOT EDIT, this file is generated by `rake mesh:create_indexes`
  # See RAILS_ROOT/lib/tasks/mesh.rake for more information
  #
  # Using MeshKeywordLookup.[], you can look up the MeSH ID
  # for any MeSH Heading. Since there are not very many MeSH
  # terms, it's faster to hold these in memory than to hit the DB
  #
  # MeSH lookups are NOT case sensitive.
  #
  # === Example
  # MeshKeywordLookup['aging']
  # => 375
